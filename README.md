# üíß Smart Irrigation System with ESP32 and Adafruit IO

This is an IoT-based smart irrigation system that automates plant watering using a real **water pump** controlled by a relay module. The system monitors soil moisture levels in real time via an OLED display and allows remote control via the Adafruit IO dashboard.

## üåü Features
- Automatic watering with a real water pump when soil is dry
- OLED display for live data visualization
- Manual pump control via Adafruit IO
- Wi-Fi connection using ESP32
- Dual operation modes: Automatic and Manual
- Cloud-based monitoring with MQTT

## üîå Circuit Connections

| Component           | ESP32 Pin  | Description                 |
|---------------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| Soil Sensor (AOUT)  | GPIO32     | Analog moisture reading     |
| Relay IN            | GPIO25     | Pump control signal         |
| OLED SDA            | GPIO21     | I2C data                    |
| OLED SCL            | GPIO22     | I2C clock                   |
| GND (All)           | GND        | Common ground               |
| VCC (OLED + Sensor) | 3.3V       | Power source                |
| Relay VCC           | 3.3V or 5V | Depends on relay module     |
| Pump + VCC          | Relay NO   | Pump powered via relay      |

‚ö†Ô∏è *Ensure proper power supply for the pump (e.g., external 5V if needed).*
